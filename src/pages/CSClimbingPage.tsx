                    The Climbing Diary is an Android App for climbers and boulderers to log their projects and ascents. The goal of the case study is a redesign by focusing on the main functionalities the user expects from a climbing App. Therefore, we conducted a user survey and a comparison of other famous applications in this area.

                    To note an ascent in climbing or bouldering there are several tools. A well-known and widely used tool is the route database and community site 8a.nu. But also theCrag offers the possibility to create a logbook. In addition, there are other digital tools, but our survey has also shown that users like to develop individual solutions in the form of their own tables or analog notes prefer.

                    I want to understand what a user expects from a Climbing logbook, so they will love to use it and to gain new insights about there skills based on past climbs. So we focus on two topics: logging a route or a project, and getting information gained from visualizations. As a result, the Climbing Diary App should be redesigned.

                    I created a questionnaire consisting of 11 questions to learn more from climbers about how they track their climbs and what evaluations they use. For the link to the questionnaire I created a QR code to distribute it faster and easier to people I met in the crag.

                            <li>Users would like to add more information (such as GPS coordinates, photos, route character, belayer, etc.) to a route to better remember it later.</li>
