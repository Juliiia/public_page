        "content": "Abstract: Requirements traceability is the ability to trace requirements to other software engineering artifacts. Traceability can be classified as either pre- or post-requirements specifications (RS) traceability. Pre-RS traceability is the ability to trace between requirements and their origin. However, the benefits of pre-RS traceability are often not clear. In this article, we systematically lay out the benefits of pre-RS traceability. We present results from both a literature review and a qualitative survey of practitioners involved with documenting and utilizing such trace links. We find that the benefits strongly depend on the practitioners, their tasks, and the project environment. Awareness of these relationships supports a clearer understanding of the benefits of pre-RS traceability and thus motivates successful implementation of the required practices. The results of our research motivates the adoption of pre-RS traceability and present problem areas for future research.",

        "title": "A systematic literature review of pre-requirements specification traceability",
        "content": "Abstract: Requirements traceability (RT) is the ability to link requirements to other software development artifacts. In pre-requirements (pre-RS) traceability, requirements are linked to their origin, such as interviews with stakeholders, meeting protocols, or legacy systems. Compared with post-RS traceability, which links requirements to source code and other later artifacts, pre-RS traceability has seen much less research. This article presents a systematic literature review of pre-RS traceability based on 77 articles published between 1992 and 2022, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of its use cases, benefits, problems, and solutions. Through the analysis of existing literature, this review identifies gaps for future research and establishes a foundation for future investigations in the field of pre-RS traceability.",

        "content": "Resolving issues that arise in a software project becomes more expensive as the project advances. Hence, it is crucial for a requirements engineer to develop a complete, consistent, and traceable requirements specification (RS). To create such a high-quality RS, the requirements engineer must develop a deep understanding of the problem domain. In science, researchers face a similar challenge when building theories. Constructing a theory requires considering all related resources to capture a broad diversity of characteristics. In addition, researchers must document the theory-building process to demonstrate high quality and ensure traceability for other researchers who want to build on the theory. Therefore, researchers developed methods for theory building, from which we draw inspiration for our research.",
